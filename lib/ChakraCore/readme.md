This folder contains pre-built ChakraCore libraries for macOS, Ubuntu and Windows

chakracore.dll - Windows 10, x64, Release
libChakraCore.dylib - macOS Sierra, amd64, Release
libChakraCore.so - Ubuntu 16.04.1, amd64, Release


These pre-build binaries are only included for convenience as ChakraCore is a relatively big build and these cover the majority of platforms.

For other platforms, build [ChakraCore](https://github.com/microsoft/chakracore/) yourself and overwrite the dynamic libary for the target platform in the output folder.
